This is a kernel based hack for reset soft BAD blocks on NAND devices.
Please in file openwrt.mk specify WRTP path to OpenWrt source and do make mips.

Then transfer the test_m.ko to target mips system and do the folowing
commands for reset BAD blocks on /dev/mtdX nand:

  insmod /tmp/test_m.ko
  mtd erase /dev/mtdX
  reboot
